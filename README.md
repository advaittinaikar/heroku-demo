# Advait's Me Bot

This is the Me Bot built by Advait Tinaikar for Programming for Online Prototypes.

To use this, all you need to do is SMS a set of commands to the number +1 412-436-5650.

First contact Advait to get your number registered onto his Twilio account.

The set of commands you can ask the bot are:
1. Where is Advait
2. What the weather there is like
3. Where he's studied
4. Where he's worked
5. What he classes he has this week or the ones he had last week
6. His assignments this week or those from last week
7. Details of his portfolio (profile picture might not be displayed properly!)
